## Introduction:
 A mini-project which was prepared for a interview. The text/requirements below was taken from the interviewer.

The Celebrity Name Game is a game that consists of matching pictures of actors from a movie to those
actors' names. What might a game like that look like?

A user would come to your website and be able to enter a movie title of his/her choosing. Once he/she
has submitted a movie title, five different pictures of actors from that movie should appear on the page.
Underneath those pictures, should be a shuffled list of names, each of which should correspond to one of
the pictures above. Next, a user should be able to match up each of the actors' names with one of the
pictures. After they've matched all of them, there should be some sort of scoring mechanism so they can
see how they did!

## Technical Requirements:
1. One or more API integrations should be used to complete this project, we leave which API(s) up to you!
2. When a user submits a movie title, the actor name and picture data should be retrieved via AJAX request.
3. The pictures of the actors and their names should be in random order, it is a game after all!
4. The matching mechanism can be implemented in a number of ways, examples range from matching pictures
   and names by numbering them or by creating a more complex UI using jQuery UI. Again, we leave the final
   design to you!
5. Some effort should be put into implementing basic styling. (e.g. formatting the images, positioning)
6. The scoring mechanism should add to a user's score when there are positive matches. Mismatches should
   not be counted.
